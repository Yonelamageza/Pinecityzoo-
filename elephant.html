                <h3>Elephants</h3>
<p>Elephants are the largest land mammals on earth and have distinctly massive bodies, large ears, and long trunks.</p>
<p>They use their trunks to pick up objects, trumpet warnings, greet other elephants, or suck up water for drinking or bathing, among other uses.</p>
<p>Both male and female African elephants grow tusks and each individual can either be left- or right-tusked, and the one they use more is usually smaller because of wear and tear.</p>
<p>Elephant tusks serve many purposes.</p>
<p>These extended teeth can be used to protect the elephant's trunk, lift and move objects, gather food, and strip bark from trees.</p>
<p>They can also be used for defense.</p>
<p>During times of drought, elephants even use their tusks to dig holes to find water underground.</p>
