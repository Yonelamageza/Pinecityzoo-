                <h3>Lions</h3>
                <p>Lions have strong, compact bodies and powerful forelegs, teeth and jaws for pulling down and killing prey.</p>
                <p>Their coats are yellow-gold, and adult males have shaggy manes that range in color from blond to reddish-brown to black.</p>
                <p>The length and color of a lion's mane is likely determined by age, genetics and hormones.</p>
                <p>Young lions have light spotting on their coats that disappears as they grow.</p>
